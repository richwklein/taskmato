# Taskmato

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

**Taskmato** is pivoting to a macOS menubar Pomodoro timer built around Apple Reminders. The app will let you start a timer from a share sheet, show a live timer in the menubar, and open a full circular timer window with controls, breaks, and stats.

## Project Direction

- macOS SwiftUI app with a menubar status item and a main timer window
- Share extension to pick a Reminder and start a timer
- Reminders integration for listing and searching tasks
- Local storage for sessions, settings, and per-reminder totals

## Marketing Site

The `taskmato` URL will host a static GitHub Pages landing page that advertises the macOS app.
